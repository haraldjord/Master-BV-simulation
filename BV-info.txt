Vehicle presetting of outer lid height from bottom: h_bot = 85.5 [mm]
Piston position that result in equilibrium water surface 10.72 [mm] 
	 piston_pos < 10.72 --> floating 
	 piston_pos > 10.72 --> sinking
h_bot seems to have an deviation of about 1.5mm (sim 85.50 == real 84.00) BUT THIS NEDS VERIFICATION, AND MIGHT BE CHANGING WITH NEW BATTERY PACKAGE
rho min vehicle: 1017.85 	 rho max vehicle 1028.52 	 delta rho vehicle: 10.67 
rho min water:   1020.07 	 rho max water:  1025.97 	 delta rho water: 5.89 
Warning! minimum water density not at surface. Make sure vehicle are able to float to surface.

maximum linear speed of piston: 2.440 [mm/s]
