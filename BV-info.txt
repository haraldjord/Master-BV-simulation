Vehicle presetting of outer lid height from bottom: h_bot = 129.0 [mm]
Piston position that result in equilibrium water surface 10.50 [mm] 
	 piston_pos < 10.50 --> floating 
	 piston_pos > 10.50 --> sinking
h_bot seems to have an deviation of about 1.5mm (sim 129.00 == real 127.50) BUT THIS NEDS VERIFICATION, AND MIGHT BE CHANGING WITH NEW BATTERY PACKAGE
rho min vehicle: 1004.87 	 rho max vehicle 1014.49 	 delta rho vehicle: 9.62 
rho min water:   1006.84 	 rho max water:  1014.89 	 delta rho water: 8.05
